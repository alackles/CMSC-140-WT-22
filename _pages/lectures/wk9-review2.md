Today's class is primarily a review of topics. Some of the topics we'll be reviewing today are:

- Lists
- Dictionaries
- File I/O
- Modules like `random` and `matplotlib`
- Visualization
- Different ways to save and access data

I'll code up a short data exploration using major league baseball data and take questions along the way. You can find the code  titled `wk9-review2.py` at this [link](https://github.com/alackles/CMSC-140-WT-23/tree/main/_pages/lectures/code). If you miss class and have questions, we can meet and discuss.
