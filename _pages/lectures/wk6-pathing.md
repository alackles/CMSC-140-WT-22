# Pathing

We are going to talk today first about how to work with paths on your computer, without worrying too much about how to use Python to interact with or change these paths. The primary goal here is to understand what a file path is before we start using them in Python.

Rather than typing out my own guide to paths, I am providing you here with resources that might be helpful, and we will do some examples in class.
