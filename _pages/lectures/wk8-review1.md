Today's class is primarily a review of topics. Some of the topics we'll be reviewing today are:

- Variables and keeping good variable names
- `if/else` statements and how to use them
- Handling user input
- Functions
- File I/O
- Modules like `random` and `matplotlib`
- Visualization

I'll code up a short project involving a wandering chicken and take questions along the way. You can find the code  titled `wk8-review1.py` at this [link](https://github.com/alackles/CMSC-140-WT-23/tree/main/_pages/lectures/code). If you miss class and have questions, we can meet and discuss.
