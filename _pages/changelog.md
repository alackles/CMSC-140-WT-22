# Changes from Previous Years

## Schedule Changes

- WEEK 1: Combine setup lab and variables/types so that that information comes after a full Python setup
- WEEK 3: Introduce more data types, and move before functions (for practical scheduling reasons)
    - Day 1: Lists and Dictionaries introduced in contrast to each other
    - Lab day: Exploration of other data containers: sets, tuples, ordereddicts, and counters
- WEEK 4: Split functions into two days, and integrate scope and imports into each of those days
    - Day 1: Functions with print statements only and an overview of scope. 
    - Day 2: Functions with return statements and an overview of imports.
- WEEK 9: Give two full days for student choice from a variety of selected topics

## Assessment & Grading Changes
- Autograding
  - Students will be able to submit code to an autograder, which runs a multitude of test cases 
  - Students will be able to see which test cases pass and fail and adjust their code accordingly before final submission
  - Students will still receive written feedback of the style given this term
- New learning objective: reading and interpreting written instructional materials 
  - To accompany the new learning objective, reading for the course will be on Perusall
  - Students will be required to read before class and make comments on perusall to meet this learning objective 
- Final Project Draft & Peer Review
  - No longer eligible to be turned in late without prior notice 
  - Drafts need not be in any particular form to be turned in
- Attendance
  - Attendance will NOT be part of the grade and will not be mandatory, but WILL be tracked

## Structural Changes

- Groupwork
  - Group work will be more frequent and more solidified, i.e., students will be assigned groups (their tables) that they can work in both in and outside of class
  - Grades will still be individualized, as will feedback
  - The exact structure of groupwork is still up in the air, so let me know what you think works and doesn't work in your other classes.
