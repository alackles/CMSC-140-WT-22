# Homework 5: File I/O

The puprose of this homework is to get some practice with file input and output as well as with debugging (fixing problems) other people's code. 

Turn in your **fixed Python script** to Gradescope; no need to upload the input or output files. 

Make sure to follow the collaboration policy for all homework.

## Assessment

For **proficiency** credit, your code should correctly produce the requested output file. 

For **mastery** credit, you should have _comments_ indicating all the changes you made to the broken code and 

## Homework: `grades.py`

Download and unzip [this zip file](https://github.com/alackles/CMSC-140-WT-23/blob/main/_pages/hwk/) containing some fake student data and some code that is supposed to output a report of which students are passing and failing the class. 

However, the code is broken; some of the errors are logical, others are typos. It is your job to fix this code using any outside resources you wish. 

When you are done, your `result.txt` file should look like this:

```
Anna is passing.
Betsy is failing.
Carol is passing.
Delilah is failing.
Emily is passing.
Francesca is passing.
Gemini is passing.
```
