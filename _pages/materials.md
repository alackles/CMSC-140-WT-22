# Homework

Here you'll find all your homeworks. The final column in this table, _Guaranteed Feedback_, is the last day you can resubmit for guaranteed feedback within one week. You can resubmit after that date, but the speed of your feedback is up to my schedule!

| HW Link | Assigned | Due | Guaranteed Feedback |  
| ------ | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| [Homework 1][hw-1] | 1/12  | 1/19 | TBD  |
| [Homework 2][hw-2] | 1/20  | 1/27 | TBD  |

# Labs

Labs will be made available before class. Each lab will have to be turned in on Canvas; you should be able to turn it in by the end of class, but as always, later submissions are accepted.

| Lab Link | Date | Guaranteed Feedback |  
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| [Lab 1][lab-1] | 1/5 | N/A |
| [Lab 2][lab-2] | 1/12 | 1/24 |
| [Lab 2][lab-2] | 1/19 | TBD |

# Lecture Notes

Lecture notes will be posted the day of class and may be edited afterwards to reflect live-coding. Lecture notes will include a link to directly download any code or scripts we wrote together in class. 

| Notes | Date |
| ----- | ------- |
| [If/Else][notes-wk2-if] | 1/9 |
| [For and While loops][w2-d2] | 1/11 |
| [Lists and Dictionaries][w3-d1] | 1/18 |

# Guides

Guides to installation practices or supplementary materials will be listed here.

# Additional Practice

Here are resources  for additional practice, each with solutions. These are available if you want to try them; there's no need to submit them.
## Basic Practice Problems

[PYnative](https://pynative.com/python-exercises-with-solutions/)

These problems are pretty straightforward ways to get used to the basics of Python programming.

## Word Problems

[w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/)

For problems more like the ones I ask on the homeworks, this site gives you more vague instructions about what to do with your program, and you have to practice interpreting it. 

## Challenge Problems

These problems go beyond the material we cover in class and introduce additional concepts and tools in Python that may be of interest to you.
